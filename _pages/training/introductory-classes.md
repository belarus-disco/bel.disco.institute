PLAIN is dedicated to helping federal agencies train their staff to communicate clearly and develop their own plain language programs. We'll train your managers as well.

We offer free, half-day training classes for federal agencies. All of our classes are based on the [Federal Plain Language Guidelines]({{ site.baseurl }}/guidelines/) and involve interactive writing exercises.

In light of OPM guidance and increasing concerns about COVID-19 (coronavirus), we are suspending accepting training requests.

## Class descriptions

- Use plain language techniques to create clear and effective writing
- Learn how using plain language can save your agency time and resources

## Request training

**NOTE:** In light of OPM guidance and increasing concerns about COVID-19 (coronavirus), we are suspending accepting training requests.



### Please note

All of our trainers are volunteers, and we only offer training for federal agencies. Requesting agencies must pay all trainer expenses, including parking within the DC metro area (if needed) and lodging, travel, and per diem outside the metro area. We can’t always fulfill requests for classes outside the area because only one volunteer trainer is authorized by their home agency to travel.

If you are not a federal employee requesting training for your agency, you can find other training options under **Public Resources** on [our main training page]({{ site.baseurl }}/training/).
